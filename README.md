# C-Basics
BS-Computer Engineering Projects

This C# project (Basic Calculator) is coded through the use of online C# compiler and not by using Visual Studio.
It is for the reason that the student does not have the necesssary resources to download and install a significantly huge software for he is only on his dorm at the moment. 
But still, the student mnaged to code a perfectly working code without the use of the said software.
